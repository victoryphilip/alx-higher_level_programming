# 0x14 - JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* Why JavaScript programming is amazing
* How to manipulate JSON data
* How to use `request` and fetch API
* How to read and write a file using `fs` module
